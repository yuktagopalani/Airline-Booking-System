<h1>Specific Technology</h1>
<p>Java, Applet</p>
<h1>Project Tasks</h1>
<p>Use case analysis, Design, Implementation, and User Interface</p>
<h1>Functional components of the project</h1>
<p>Following is a list of functionalities of the system. More functionality that you find appropriate
can be added to this list. And, in places where the description of functionality is not adequate,
you can make appropriate assumptions and proceed.
Existing Airline information is already stored in the local memory. Any new passenger
information can be stored in the local memory via a passenger information input screen. The
screen will take as input all the details of the passenger along with his name, the whole address
he belongs from, the journey details also the Identity proof details like Pan Card number etc.

<ul>
<li>UML diagrams:-Use Case diagram, Class diagram, CRC diagram(s), illustrating the
